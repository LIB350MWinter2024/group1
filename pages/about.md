## About the Collection

The Oregon Flora Collection (OFC) is a collection of botanical photographs and illustrations.

The collection was created by four students at the University of Oregon with a variety of educational backgrounds in majors like English, Dance, and Journalism. Despite their different majors, these students found a common interest in Oregon flora. They wanted to make a collection for people in Oregon who enjoy the plants they see everyday, but aren't scientists. As a result, none of the plants in this collection are referred to using their scientific names, but instead their common names.
