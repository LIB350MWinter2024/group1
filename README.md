# LIB 400: Humanities Data Management Winter 2024

This course provides students with theoretical and practical experience in collecting, processing, archiving, and publishing humanities data (images, video, sound, text, maps, etc.) gathered from galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAMs). With the goal of building thematic digital collections as researchers, students will learn digital methodologies focusing on the technical, legal, ethical, and social aspects of working with humanities research data throughout its curation lifecycle. This includes hands-on experience finding, assessing, organizing, and reformatting data; creating and remediating descriptive metadata; evaluating and determining copyright and licensing; writing a data management plan using the standards set by the National Endowment for the Humanities, and sharing thematic research digital collections using GitHub and the opensource platform CollectionBuilder.

This repository was created by Frida Heitland and edited by Chloe Gold, Cassidy Perkins, Haley Sherman, and Danielle Lichtenstein.

## Oregon Flora Collection

The Oregon Flora Collection is for people in Oregon who enjoy the plants they see everyday, but aren’t scientists. As a result, none of the plants in this collection are referred to using their scientific names, but instead their common names.
